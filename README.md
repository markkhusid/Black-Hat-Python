# Black-Hat-Python
Scripts from the book, including my modifications for Python3 and/or 64 bit machines, ARM processor, etc.

Some scripts in Chapters 2 and 3 do not work on a 64 bit machine.  I am also running these primarily on an ARM Chromebook, so I run into processor dependent integer storage issues.
I am working through these issues by trying to isolate the code that is causing the error as a way to gain a deeper understanding into the underlying mechanics and to learn Python programming.
Feel free to look around and please send me a message with tips or suggestions.  Thank you.
